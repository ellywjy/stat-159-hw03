# Statistics 159 - Homework #2

This is the repo for HW 2, where we will use git, github, R, and Makefiles to reproduce the statistical analysis presented in Section 3.1 of "An Introduction to Statistical Learning."

The structure of this project is as follow:

* **code** folder contains all the R scripts used for running regressions and producing plots.  
* **data** folder contains the raw and processed data ready to be used in the final report.  
* **images** contains all the images produced by the R scripts. This folder will also contain the pdf versions of the graphs along with a png version.  
* **report** will contain a Rmd file with the narrative of the final report and a pdf file which is the final report created by knitting the Rmd file.  
* The **Makefile** in this home directory can be used to create and remove all pdf, images, and txt files in this directory.
