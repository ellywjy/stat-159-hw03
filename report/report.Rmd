## Abstract
In section 3.1 - *Simple Linear Regression* of the book **An Introduction to Statistical Learning**, we used the data set for advertising and performed simple linear regression of Sales on TV budget. In this report we will reproduce the graphs, regression, and analysis in a reproducible manner.  

## Introduction
The purpose of advertising for a certain good is to hopefully to increase its sales. With the technologies available today, there are many possible channels for advertisements to reach their audience. In this report, we will focus on the relationship between the budget alloted for TV advertisement and Sales of a particular good and see if we can determine whether there is a relationship and association between the two variables. 

## Data 
The advertising data used in the book consists of **Sales** (in thousands of units) of a particular prouduct in 200 different markets and advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) for the product in each of those markets. In particular, the advertising budgets were for **TV**, **Radio**, and **Newspaper**. 

## Methodology
In this paper, we will be focusing in particular on the relationship between the Sales (in thousands of units) and TV budget (in thousands of dollars). In particular, our model for the simple linear regression will be: 

\begin{center}

 Sales  = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1$ * TV

\end{center}

 To esimate the coefficients for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, we will perform the ordinary least squares regression in R. 

## Results

Using OLS, we get the estimates of the coefficients as shown below in Table 1.

```{r results= 'asis', echo =FALSE}
load("../data/regression.RData")
library(xtable)
tb1 <- xtable(regression, caption = 'Information about Regression Coefficients')
print(tb1, comment= FALSE)
```

From the table, we can see that for every thousand dollar increase in the budget for TV, sales is predicted to increase by 47.5 units. Since the standard error for the estimate of $\beta_1$ is quite low and the t-statistic is quite high, we can say that our estimate is signficiantly different from zero.
The estimate of $\beta_0$ tells that that even when there are no budget alloted to TV, we'd expect the sales to be at around 7.03 thousands of units. 

Regarding the regression quality and the fitness of our regression, we reference the following table (Table 2). 

```{r results= 'asis', echo =FALSE}

sumtb <- data.frame(c("Residual standard error", "R Squared", "F-Statistics") ,c(reg_summary$sigma, reg_summary$r.squared, reg_summary$fstatistic[1]))

colnames(sumtb) <- c("Quantity", "Value")

tb2 <- xtable(sumtb, digits = 2, caption = 'Regression Quality Indicies')

print(tb2, comment =FALSE, include.rownames=FALSE)

```

In this table, we see that the sum of the residuals squared is `r round(reg_summary$sigma,2)`, which is a fairly low number for RSS. In doing OLS, we tried to minimize the sum of residuals squared because RSS is directly related to the RSE, which is a measure of lack of fit.  
Another way to measure the fitness of a regression is through $R^2$ From the table, $R^2$ is 0.61, which means that 61% of the changes in sales is predicted by the changes in TV budget. This number is not considered too high, as 0.99 means close to perfect fit, but it's also not too bad for a fitness test. 
The high F-statistic in the table also tells us that the estimated coefficents in this regression is significantly different from zero. 

The scatterplot of Sales on TV with the regression lines fitted is shown below:
